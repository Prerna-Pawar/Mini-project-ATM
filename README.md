Here I have created a mini project of ATM using C++.
So this mini project is going to consist of ATM functionalities implimented using OOP's concept.
The functionalities are: 1) Check balance: The user can check the balance of his account. 2) Cash WithDraw: User can Withdraw cash from the ATM. But the only condition is
user must enter the valid input, like the amout to be withdraw should be less than account balance. 3) User Details: User the see and cross check his details in bank.
4) Update Mobile no. :The user can update his mobile number.
